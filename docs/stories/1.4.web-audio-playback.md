# Story 1.4: Instant Web Audio Playback

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** standup comedian,
**I want** to immediately play the generated audio in my browser without downloads,
**so that** I can quickly hear my material and iterate on it during writing sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. HTML5 audio player appears immediately after successful text-to-speech conversion
2. Standard audio controls (play, pause, seek bar, volume) are clearly visible and functional
3. Audio playback begins within 1 second of clicking play button
4. Seek functionality allows jumping to any point in the audio timeline
5. Volume control provides smooth adjustment from 0% to 100%
6. Visual feedback indicates current playback position and remaining duration
7. Audio player persists during session until new text is converted or page is refreshed

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
[Source: Story 1.3 Completion Notes]
- Complete TTS integration with Web Speech API and Google Cloud TTS fallback
- Audio content generation with metadata (duration, format, file size)
- Audio streaming endpoints implemented: `GET /api/audio/stream/{id}`
- useTTS hook provides conversion status and audio content management
- Frontend-backend integration patterns established for real-time updates

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Frontend Architecture]

**AudioPlayer UI Component:**
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/ui/AudioPlayer/`
- Type: Reusable UI primitive for HTML5 audio playback
- Props interface: `{ src: string, autoPlay?: boolean, onTimeUpdate?: (time: number) => void, onEnded?: () => void }`
- Styling: CSS Modules with `.audioPlayer`, `.controls`, `.seekBar`, `.volumeSlider` classes
- Features: Custom controls, seek functionality, volume management, time display

**Audio Player Integration:**
- Integration point: TextInput component displays AudioPlayer after successful TTS conversion
- State management: useAudioPlayer hook manages playback state and audio settings
- Audio sources: Support both Web Speech API audio and streamed MP3 files
- Session persistence: Audio player remains visible until new conversion or page refresh

### Technical Specifications
[Source: architecture.md#Audio Player Service]

**HTML5 Audio Integration:**
- Use HTML5 `<audio>` element with custom control overlay
- Support streaming audio sources from `/api/audio/stream/{id}` endpoints
- Implement progressive loading for immediate playback start
- Handle both file-based audio (Google TTS) and Web Speech API audio

**Audio Control Requirements:**
- Play/pause button with loading states
- Seek bar with click and drag interaction
- Volume slider with percentage display (0-100%)
- Time display: MM:SS format for current time and total duration
- Responsive design supporting mobile touch interactions

### Performance and User Experience
[Source: architecture.md#Performance Optimization]

**Playback Performance Targets:**
- Audio playback start: < 1 second after clicking play (AC requirement)
- Seek operation response: < 200ms for smooth user experience
- Volume adjustment: Real-time feedback with smooth transitions
- UI responsiveness: No blocking operations during audio loading/streaming

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- Visual feedback for all audio operations (play state, loading, errors)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations (spacebar play/pause, arrow seek/volume)
- Persistent audio state during session (survives text edits, navigation)
- Graceful degradation for unsupported audio formats or browser limitations

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture.md#Unified Project Structure]

**Component Files:**
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/AudioPlayer/AudioPlayer.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/AudioPlayer/AudioPlayer.module.css`
- `apps/web/src/components/ui/AudioPlayer/AudioPlayer.test.tsx`

**Hook Files:**
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts`
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.test.ts`

**Integration Files:**
- `apps/web/src/components/features/TextInput/TextInput.tsx` (updated)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useTTS.ts` (updated with audio URL management)

**Test Files:**
- `apps/web/tests/e2e/audio-playback.spec.ts`

### Integration with Existing Systems
[Source: Story 1.3 Implementation]

**TTS Integration Points:**
- useTTS hook provides `currentAudio` with audio content metadata
- Audio streaming through existing `/api/audio/stream/{id}` endpoint
- Error handling integration with existing TTS error management
- Session management integration for audio persistence

**Web Speech API Considerations:**
- Web Speech API generates audio directly in browser (no file streaming)
- Handle both streamed audio files and browser-generated audio
- Consistent UI regardless of audio source (Web Speech vs Google TTS)
- Fallback handling when audio generation fails

### Styling Standards
[Source: architecture.md#CSS Architecture]

**CSS Modules Pattern:**
- Component-scoped styles using `.module.css` files
- Audio control naming: `.audioPlayer`, `.playButton`, `.seekBar`, `.volumeControl`
- Use CSS custom properties from `apps/web/src/styles/variables.css`
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach for touch controls
- High contrast mode support for accessibility

**Visual Design Requirements:**
- Clean, modern audio player design consistent with text input interface
- Clear visual hierarchy: play button prominence, secondary controls
- Intuitive seek bar with hover states and drag feedback
- Volume control with clear visual indication of current level

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Technical Standards]

**WCAG AA Compliance:**
- Proper ARIA labels for all audio controls
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Spacebar, Arrow keys)
- Screen reader compatibility with audio status announcements
- High contrast mode support for control visibility
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- Spacebar: Play/pause toggle
- Left/Right arrows: Seek backward/forward (5 seconds)
- Up/Down arrows: Volume increase/decrease
- M key: Mute/unmute toggle
- Home/End: Jump to beginning/end of audio

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
[Source: architecture.md#Error Handling Strategy]

**Audio-Specific Error Codes:**
- `AUDIO_LOAD_FAILED` - Audio file could not be loaded
- `AUDIO_DECODE_ERROR` - Audio format not supported by browser
- `AUDIO_NETWORK_ERROR` - Network failure during audio streaming
- `AUDIO_PLAYER_NOT_SUPPORTED` - Browser lacks audio playback capability

**Error Recovery Strategies:**
- Retry audio loading with exponential backoff
- Fallback to alternative audio sources if available
- Clear error messaging with user-actionable recommendations
- Graceful degradation to basic browser audio controls if custom controls fail
