# StandUp Voice Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable standup comedians to quickly convert written material to audio for immediate testing and refinement
- Provide instant web-based audio playback that eliminates download/upload friction from the testing workflow
- Deliver a simple, no-account-required tool that integrates seamlessly into existing comedy writing processes
- Support iterative material development through fast audio generation and playback cycles
- Create foundation for future comedy-specific audio enhancement and timing optimization features

### Background Context

StandUp Voice addresses a critical gap in the comedy development workflow where comedians need objective audio feedback on their written material before live performance. Currently, comedians must rely on inconsistent self-delivery when testing material, which undermines effective development and increases performance risk. Existing text-to-speech solutions are either too complex for quick iteration or lack the immediate web-based playback that comedy writers need for rapid material testing.

The comedy industry lacks tools specifically designed for the iterative, timing-sensitive nature of standup material development. Generic TTS services require complex interfaces or account setup, disrupting the fast-paced creative process that comedy writing demands. By providing instant text-to-speech conversion with immediate web playback, StandUp Voice enables comedians to hear their material within seconds and iterate quickly during writing sessions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

StandUp Voice prioritizes extreme simplicity and speed above all other considerations. The interface should feel like a streamlined notepad with instant audio feedback - no clutter, no complex navigation, just text input and immediate playback. The design should eliminate all friction between written material and audio output, enabling comedians to focus entirely on their creative process rather than learning or navigating software.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **One-Page Workflow:** All core functionality (input, convert, play, download) accessible from a single screen
- **Instant Feedback:** Visual and audio feedback appears immediately upon user actions (typing, uploading, playing)
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Advanced features are discoverable but don't interfere with the core simple workflow
- **Touch-Friendly Controls:** All interactive elements sized appropriately for both mouse and touch interaction

### Core Screens and Views

- **Main Dashboard:** Single-page interface with text input area, audio player, and basic controls
- **Audio Controls Panel:** Expandable section with advanced playback and export options
- **Session History Sidebar:** Collapsible panel showing recent text versions and generated audio files

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast ratios. Audio controls will include proper ARIA labels and keyboard shortcuts for users who cannot use mouse input.

### Branding

Clean, professional design with comedy-friendly personality touches. Color scheme should be modern and accessible while avoiding overly playful elements that might seem unprofessional. Typography should prioritize readability for extended text input and editing sessions.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop browsers for extended text editing sessions, with fully functional mobile responsive design for quick material testing on phones and tablets. No native mobile apps planned for MVP.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing both frontend and backend code using npm workspaces. This approach simplifies development coordination and deployment while maintaining clear separation between client and server concerns.

### Service Architecture

Simple client-server monolithic architecture with React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. TTS processing handled via external API calls (Web Speech API primary, Google Cloud TTS and Azure TTS as fallbacks). No microservices complexity needed for MVP scope - focus on rapid development and deployment.

### Testing Requirements

Unit testing for core business logic and API endpoints using Jest. Integration testing for TTS service integration and file upload functionality. Manual testing for audio playback across different browsers and devices. No end-to-end testing framework initially - rely on comprehensive manual testing protocols.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- Local development environment setup with minimal external dependencies
- Environment variable configuration for TTS API keys and service endpoints
- Automatic fallback logic between TTS services based on availability and response times
- Client-side audio caching to reduce repeat API calls for identical text
- Progressive web app capabilities for improved mobile experience
- Error logging and monitoring integration for production debugging
